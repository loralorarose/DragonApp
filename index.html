<h4> As the name suggests, fire dragons have everything to do with fire.</h4> 
 <p> 1. they can breathe fire any time they want, with no recharge required.<br> 
2. they are resistant to any kind of flame or lava.<br> 
3. they are very good flyers, but they are deathly afraid of water or ice.</p> 
</h4> 

<h4>Some fire dragon sub-types include <a href="#lava-dragon">lava dragons</a> and <a href="#magma-dragon">magma dragons</a>.</h4>

<h4>Sea dragons have these common abilities.</h4>
   
    <p>1. they can breathe under water and on land<br>
    2. they are exremely fast swimmers, however they are slow fliers and cannot dig<br>
    3. they take no damage from sea dragon attacks, but fire dragons' attacks do 1 and a half times the normal amount</p>
